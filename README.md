# HeureDeVol

HeureDeVol aims to be a complete pilot logbook application with the following features:
- Flexible data storage on the client side as much as possible.
- Real and virtual (gaming) flights following, with the possibility to have multiple logbooks.
- Expandable data fields to cater for specific usage, such as Carrier traps or air to air kills, etc.
- Statistics and alerts typically used by pilots, qualifications expirations, etc.

It is also a means for me to learn React and other tools, such as Vite, Tailwind, and whatnot.
